    🥬 🥬 🥬 🥬 Transfer protocols response fields. 🥬 (Optional)

    Certain anchors may provide users with the option to deposit or withdraw assets in and out
    of the Stellar network, directly from their wallets. For such assets, the transaction_protocols field is an object containing all transfer protocols the anchor supports for that asset.

    Pure stellar assets that only exist within the Stellar network need not define this field.
    Asset-backed tokens on the other hand are encouraged to:
      🍎 either implement SEP24 for interactive anchor/wallet asset transfer,
      🍎 or SEP26 for non-interactive anchor/wallet asset transfer.

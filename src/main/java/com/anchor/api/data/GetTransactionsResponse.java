        üçé üçé üçé üçé üçé status should be one of:

        completed -- deposit/withdrawal fully completed.
        pending_external -- deposit/withdrawal has been submitted to external network, but is not yet confirmed. This is the status when waiting on Bitcoin or other external crypto network to complete a transaction, or when waiting on a bank transfer.
        pending_anchor -- deposit/withdrawal is being processed internally by anchor.
        pending_stellar -- deposit/withdrawal operation has been submitted to Stellar network, but is not yet confirmed.
        pending_trust -- the user must add a trust-line for the asset for the deposit to complete.
        pending_user -- the user must take additional action before the deposit / withdrawal can complete.
        pending_user_transfer_start -- the user has not yet initiated their transfer to the anchor. This is the necessary first step in any deposit or withdrawal flow.
        incomplete -- there is not yet enough information for this transaction to be initiated. Perhaps the user has not yet entered necessary info in an interactive flow.
        no_market -- could not complete deposit because no satisfactory asset/XLM market was available to create the account.
        too_small -- deposit/withdrawal size less than min_amount.
        too_large -- deposit/withdrawal size exceeded max_amount.
        error -- catch-all for any error not enumerated above.
